# LLM Education Topic Modeling

This project focuses on using **topic modeling** (specifically **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** or LDA) to explore how large language models (LLMs) are applied in educational contexts. The goal is to uncover key themes such as personalized learning, content creation, and writing assistance based on descriptions of LLM tools.

### Visualization Files:

The analysis groups the data into 5, 7, and 10 distinct topics, each representing key themes in LLM applications within education

- [7-Group Topics](https://saeed-saffari.github.io/LLM_education_topic_modeling/lda_visualization_7_group.html)
- [10-Group Topics](https://saeed-saffari.github.io/LLM_education_topic_modeling/lda_visualization_10_group.html)
